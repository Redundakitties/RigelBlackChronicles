These epubs are edited by and mostly put together by [Rebell K](https://rebell-k.tumblr.com/post/180455075430/hi-rigel-black-fans-i-have-recently-made-an-ebook). I added the last chapter of Book 4 and my covers. The original can be found [here](https://href.li/?https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LF99Iq9qbWIG9IVQSVQ9nwru1kweZ5bx?usp=sharing).

Finally, ThrawnCA converted them from FFN straight to ebooks as an all-in-one found [here](https://github.com/ThrawnCA/rbc-ebook/releases/tag/0.1).
